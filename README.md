# LeetCode Solutions

ðŸŽ¯ This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is implemented as a standalone method file, organized for easy access and reference.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by problem categories and each solution is stored in a file in the catagory. If more than one file is needed then stored into directory:

```
- problems/
  - Int/
  - xxx/
  - xxx/
- xxx/
- README.md
```

- `problems/`: Contains the solution files categorized by levels (`Int`, `xxx`, `xxx`).
- `utils/`: Includes any helper functions or reusable code snippets.
- `README.md`: This file, containing information about the repository.

## Naming Convention

Each solution file is named using the following pattern:

`<ProblemID>_<ProblemName>.<extension>`

### Example:
- `001_Two_Sum.java`
- `002_Add_Two_Numbers.java`

## Language Support
I will primarily use the following programming language for the solutions:

- **Java**

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the appropriate folder based on the level.
2. Open the solution file to view the implementation.

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/mdabdulazizzisan/LeetCode.git

# Navigate to the repository
$ cd LeetCode
```
